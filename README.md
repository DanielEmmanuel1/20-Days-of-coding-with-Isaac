# Welcome to 20 days of JavaScript re-learning with Isaac. This is going to be an extensive session and we hope to hit it while we are on it, but first let's define the rules.

## RULES
1. NO Copying of any sort. you can look at resources to get the flow but do not ever copy the code.
2. ChatGPT is meant for learning purposes, so if you do not understand the prompt, you can kindly ask it to explain like a 5-year-old.
3. All submissions are supposed to be made as of when due and for each task, your time starts from 12AM.
4. Make sure all text additions to your javascript code is all commented out.
5. There's a scoring system with 10 as the highest number of points per task and 0 as the lowest with the Pass mark set at 7. so you have to get at least 70% to pass any task.
6. Don't forget that creative examples or implementations of what you learn from a task fetches you bonus points, which you can exchange for fun items as soon as we can provide them.
7. You can choose to tweet about your progress on Twitter (doesn't fetch any bonus points)

## PROJECTS
You would have projects to build every weekend, mini or mega, all depending on my whim. I call the shots so be ready cos we are gonna build crazy things.

## FOR UNFORESEEN SITUATIONS
in case of unplanned occurrences, a simple text could exonerate you from the penalties of not completing your tasks as at when due and these penalties would be made known to you in due time.

## PENALTIES
Penalties for not completing your tasks would be a more gruesome learning experience, so do you choose to learn the hard way, or to learn the harder way? Choose your poison.

# PS: ALL MY CORRECTIONS TO YOUR TASKS CAN BE FOUND UNDERNEATH YOUR CONTENT.
That calls it for now. Let me catch some sleep and if I wake up and decide to make your life harder, I would do just that. 
VAMOS
